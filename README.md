# kestrel-feature-parametric-self

The agent's **owned parametric self** for Kestrel Sovereign.

A per-agent local model (target: Gemma 4 31B, 4-bit MLX) that is
nightly-finetuned during the sleep cycle on the agent's own experience, and —
once proven — consulted in the agent's reasoning loop as a disposition prior
and on-demand oracle alongside the frontier model.

Slogan: **rent intelligence, own identity.** This is the *parametric*
counterpart to reflection's *symbolic* self-model (the weights, not a trait
dict). It is **not** memory — RAG remains the factual layer.

Design: [`docs/TWO_BRAIN_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/TWO_BRAIN_ARCHITECTURE.md).
Build plan: epic #1.

> **Status: P0 scaffold.** The feature loads and registers; the MLX trainer,
> reflection-derived corpus, fidelity gate, and in-loop integration land in
> later phases. The Apple-Silicon trainer is imported lazily, so the package
> installs and CI-validates on any platform.

## Installation

```bash
uv pip install kestrel-feature-parametric-self
```

The package registers `ParametricSelfFeature` through the
`kestrel_sovereign.features` entry point group.
